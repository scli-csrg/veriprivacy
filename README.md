To validate the effectiveness, accuracy, and privacy guarantees of the proposed VeriPrivacy framework, experiments were conducted on two representative healthcare datasets: the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset and resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) data. These datasets were selected to evaluate VeriPrivacy across both structured clinical records and high-dimensional biomedical signals, reflecting realistic multi-institutional healthcare analytics scenarios.
